        the Device object is a dictionary, with the following additonal provisions
          - property names are changed to lower case to comply with the RFC
          - serializing property values must comply with the RFC depending on the type, and in particular
            - if the property value is a string which contains only ASCII characters, the string can be serialized as String,
              as per section 3.3.3 of the RFC
            - if the property value is a string and contains non-ASCII characters, the string must be serialized as Byte Sequence using UTF-8 encoding,

    Device:
      description: |
        End-user equipment able to connect to a mobile network. Examples of devices include smartphones or IoT sensors/actuators.
            The developer can choose to provide the below specified device identifiers:
            * `phoneNumber`
            * `networkAccessIdentifier`
            NOTE1: the network operator might support only a subset of these options. The API invoker can provide multiple identifiers to be compatible across different network operators. In this case the identifiers MUST belong to the same device.
            NOTE2: for the Commonalities release v0.4, we are enforcing that the networkAccessIdentifier is only part of the schema for future-proofing, and CAMARA does not currently allow its use. After the CAMARA meta-release work is concluded and the relevant issues are resolved, its use will need to be explicitly documented in the guidelines.

    PhoneNumber:
      description: A public identifier addressing a telephone subscription. In mobile networks it corresponds to the MSISDN (Mobile Station International Subscriber Directory Number). In order to be globally unique it has to be formatted in international format, according to E.164 standard, prefixed with '+'.
      type: string
      pattern: '^\+[1-9][0-9]{4,14}$'
      example: "+123456789"

    NetworkAccessIdentifier:
      description: A public identifier addressing a subscription in a mobile network. In 3GPP terminology, it corresponds to the GPSI formatted with the External Identifier ({Local Identifier}@{Domain Identifier}). Unlike the telephone number, the network access identifier is not subjected to portability ruling in force, and is individually managed by each operator.
