  title: Dedicated Network - Accesses
  description: |
    This API allows for requesting network access for devices. A device is identified by the CAMARA _device object_, containing either an MSIDSN or a Network Access Identifier.

    A Device Access represents the permission for a specific device to use a Dedicated Network's reserved connectivity resources. Only devices for which a Device Access resource has been created can use the connectivity resources allocated for that network. The usage of resources can be tailored to each device within the constraints of the applicable Network Profile.

    # Authorization and authentication

    The "Camara Security and Interoperability Profile" provides details of how an API consumer requests an access token. Please refer to Identity and Consent Management (https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/) for the released version of the profile.

    The specific authorization flows to be used will be agreed upon during the onboarding process, happening between the API consumer and the API provider, taking into account the declared purpose for accessing the API, whilst also being subject to the prevailing legal framework dictated by local legislation.

    In cases where personal data is processed by the API and users can exercise their rights through mechanisms such as opt-in and/or opt-out, the use of three-legged access tokens is mandatory. This ensures that the API remains in compliance with privacy regulations, upholding the principles of transparency and user-centric privacy-by-design.

    # Identifying the device from the access token

    This API requires the API consumer to identify a device as the subject of the API as follows:
    - When the API is invoked using a two-legged access token, the subject will be identified from the optional `device`, which therefore MUST be provided.
    - When a three-legged access token is used however, this optional identifier MUST NOT be provided, as the subject will be uniquely identified from the access token.

    This approach simplifies API usage for API consumers using a three-legged access token to invoke the API by relying on the information that is associated with the access token and was identified during the authentication process.

    ## Error handling:

    - If the subject cannot be identified from the access token and the optional `device` object is not included in the request, then the server will return an error with the `422 MISSING_IDENTIFIER` error code.
    - If the subject can be identified from the access token and the optional `device` object is also included in the request, then the server will return an error with the `422 UNNECESSARY_IDENTIFIER` error code. This will be the case even if the same `device` is identified by these two methods, as the server is unable to make this comparison.

    # Creating a device access

    A Device Access is created by performing a `POST` operation on the `/accesses` endpoint.

    The API Consumer provides the following information

    - the networkId to which access is being given

    - identifier of the device - either in `device` object or in the token (see "Identifying the device from the access token" above)

    - optionally, a default QoS Profile can be set for the device

    - optionally, a subset of QoS Profiles from this network can be provided to further restrict which QoS Profiles the device can access

    The API returns an accessId.

     which is needed to query the status of the Device Access (GET /accesses/{accessId}) and to delete Access (DELETE accesses/{accessId}).

    # Querying one or more device accesses

    All available device accesses of the API consumer can be queried by performing a `GET` operation on the `/accesses` endpoint. The query can be filted for accesses to a specific network (networkId) or for certain devices.

    A specific device access of the API consumer can be queried by performing a `GET` operation on the `/accesses/{accessId}` endpoint, where the accessId has been obtained during the _create_ procedure.

    # Deleting a device accesses

    A specific device access of the API consumer can be deleted by performing a `DELETE` operation on the `/accesses/{accessId}` endpoint. Deletion of the access can be interpreted as removal of the access permissions.

    # Additional CAMARA error responses

    The list of error codes in this API specification is not exhaustive. Therefore the API specification may not document some non-mandatory error statuses as indicated in `CAMARA API Design Guide`.

    Please refer to the `CAMARA_common.yaml` of the Commonalities Release associated to this API version for a complete list of error responses. The applicable Commonalities Release can be identified in the `API Readiness Checklist` document associated to this API version.

    As a specific rule, error `501 - NOT_IMPLEMENTED` can be only a possible error response if it is explicitly documented in the API.

            * `phoneNumber`
            * `networkAccessIdentifier`
            NOTE1: the network operator might support only a subset of these options. The API invoker can provide multiple identifiers to be compatible across different network operators. In this case the identifiers MUST belong to the same device.
            NOTE2: As for this Commonalities release, we are enforcing that the networkAccessIdentifier is only part of the schema for future-proofing, and CAMARA does not currently allow its use. After the CAMARA meta-release work is concluded and the relevant issues are resolved, its use will need to be explicitly documented in the guidelines.
