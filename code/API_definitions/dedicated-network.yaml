  title: Dedicated Network - Networks
  description: |
    This API allows for requesting a Dedicated Network, which provides a set of capabilities and connectivity performance targets. The Dedicated Network may be requested for a particular geographical location and at a particular time window. Depending on the requested start time for the dedicated network, the network may first enter a _reserved_ state.

    # Authorization and authentication

    The "Camara Security and Interoperability Profile" provides details of how an API consumer requests an access token. Please refer to Identity and Consent Management (https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/) for the released version of the profile.

    The specific authorization flows to be used will be agreed upon during the onboarding process, happening between the API consumer and the API provider, taking into account the declared purpose for accessing the API, whilst also being subject to the prevailing legal framework dictated by local legislation.

    In cases where personal data is processed by the API and users can exercise their rights through mechanisms such as opt-in and/or opt-out, the use of three-legged access tokens is mandatory. This ensures that the API remains in compliance with privacy regulations, upholding the principles of transparency and user-centric privacy-by-design.

    # Creating a network

    A network is created by performing a `POST` operation on the `/networks` endpoint.

    The API Consumer needs to provide the following input parameters to create a network:

    - the chosen Network Profile (profileId)

    - the Service Area

    - the service start and end times (Service Time).

    - Optionally, callback related information through sink and sinkCredential parameters to receive notifications about the lifecycle events of the network.

    The API returns a networkId. The networkId is a unique identifier of the network, which remains unchanged during its lifetime. The networkId is required when creating Device Accesses.

    Initially, the created network is in `REQUESTED` state. The network is only usable when the network is in `ACTIVATED` state. Find a detailed description of the network states [here]().


    # Querying one or more Networks

    All available network of the API consumer can be queried by performing a `GET` operation on the `/networks` endpoint.

    A specific network of the API consumer can be queried by performing a `GET` operation on the `/networks/{networkId}` endpoint, where the networkId has been obtained during the _create_ procedure.

    # Deleting a Network

    A specific network of the API consumer can be deleted by performing a `DELETE` operation on the `/networks/{networkId}` endpoint. Deletion of a network can be interpreted as a cancellation of the resource reservation.

    # Additional CAMARA error responses

    The list of error codes in this API specification is not exhaustive. Therefore the API specification may not document some non-mandatory error statuses as indicated in `CAMARA API Design Guide`.

    Please refer to the `CAMARA_common.yaml` of the Commonalities Release associated to this API version for a complete list of error responses. The applicable Commonalities Release can be identified in the `API Readiness Checklist` document associated to this API version.

    As a specific rule, error `501 - NOT_IMPLEMENTED` can be only a possible error response if it is explicitly documented in the API.

        * `RESERVED` - Request is accepted by the CSP (CSP has committed the requested resources), but the Network cannot be used (outside of requested time-window)
        * `ACTIVATED` - Network turns from reserved into Activated. Now, devices with access can use the network. Possible transitions to RESERVED or TERMINATED states
