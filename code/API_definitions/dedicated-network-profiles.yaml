  title: Dedicated Network - Network Profiles
  description: |

    # Introduction

    This API allows for discovering available network profiles, which are offered by the network provider to be used in conjunction of the Dedicated Network API. Network profiles describe the capabilities and performance targets of a dedicated network. For more information about the Dedicated Networks APIs, see [link]().

    # Network Profiles

    A Network Profile represents a predefined set of network capabilities and performance characteristics that can be applied when creating a Network. It enables API Consumers to understand the capabilities they can expect when using the reserved network connectivity resources. A Network Profile is a validated, supported configuration that has been pre-approved between the API Provider and API Consumer.

    A Network Profile contains information about the maximum number of devices allowed, the aggregated throughput to be provided, and a set of allowed QoS Profiles that devices can use when having access to the Dedicated Network. The concept of named QoS Profiles is re-used from the [QualityOnDemand](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand) API family. An API provider may offer the QualityOnDemand `qos-profiles` API for resolving a QoS Profile name into characteristics of a specific QoS profile.

    Network Profiles are designed to support different use-cases and should contain the matching `qos-profile` combinations. Generally, two types of Network Profiles can be identified
      * Network Profiles containing only a `defaultQosProfile`
      * Network Profiles containing one or more additional `qos-profile`s with the `qosProfiles` array. When multiple QoS Profiles are supported within one Network Profile, the QualityOnDemand `quality-on-demand` API may be used to assign one of the available QoS profiles to a specific device while the Network is in `ACTIVATED` state

    Devices are not neccessarily using connectivity continuously. The value of the `maxNumberOfDevices` parameter should be set _generous_, considering that not all devices using connectivity simultaneously and/or continuously.

    The parameters `aggregatedUlThroughput` and `aggregatedDlThroughput` define the (hard) limits of simultaneous connectivity usage, ie. sum of all traffic pertaining all devices using the available QoS profiles.

    A detailed description of the individual parameters may be included within the _terms and conditions_ (outside of scope for the API).

    # Network Profiles API

    The key characteristics of the API include:

    - Network Profiles are read-only resources from the API Consumer perspective

    - They are discoverable through GET operations

    - Each Network Profile has a unique identifier (profileId)

    - The profileId serves as a reference when creating a Dedicated Network

    - The API returns only Network Profiles that the API Consumer is eligible to use based on their agreements

    # Authorization and authentication

    The "Camara Security and Interoperability Profile" provides details of how an API consumer requests an access token. Please refer to Identity and Consent Management (https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/) for the released version of the profile.

    The specific authorization flows to be used will be agreed upon during the onboarding process, happening between the API consumer and the API provider, taking into account the declared purpose for accessing the API, whilst also being subject to the prevailing legal framework dictated by local legislation.

    In cases where personal data is processed by the API and users can exercise their rights through mechanisms such as opt-in and/or opt-out, the use of three-legged access tokens is mandatory. This ensures that the API remains in compliance with privacy regulations, upholding the principles of transparency and user-centric privacy-by-design.

    # Additional CAMARA error responses

    The list of error codes in this API specification is not exhaustive. Therefore the API specification may not document some non-mandatory error statuses as indicated in `CAMARA API Design Guide`.

    Please refer to the `CAMARA_common.yaml` of the Commonalities Release associated to this API version for a complete list of error responses. The applicable Commonalities Release can be identified in the `API Readiness Checklist` document associated to this API version.

    As a specific rule, error `501 - NOT_IMPLEMENTED` can be only a possible error response if it is explicitly documented in the API.
