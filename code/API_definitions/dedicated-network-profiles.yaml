  title: Dedicated Network - Network Profiles API
  description: |

    This API allows for discovering available network profiles, which are offered by the network provider to be used in conjunction of the Dedicated Network API. Network profiles describe the capabilities and performance targets of a dedicated network. For more information about the Dedicated Networks APIs, see [link]().

    A Network Profile represents a predefined set of network capabilities and performance characteristics that can be applied when creating a Network. It enables API Consumers to understand the capabilities they can expect when using the reserved network connectivity resources. A Network Profile is a validated, supported configuration that has been pre-approved between the API Provider and API Consumer.

    A Network Profile contains information about the maximum number of devices allowed, the aggregated throughput to be provided, and a set of allowed QoS Profiles that devices can use when having access to the Dedicated Network. A detailed description of the individual parameters may be included within the _terms and conditions_ (outside of scope for the API).

    The key characteristics of the API include:

    - Network Profiles are read-only resources from the API Consumer perspective

    - They are discoverable through GET operations

    - Each Network Profile has a unique identifier (profileId)

    - The profileId serves as a reference when creating a Dedicated Network

    - The API returns only Network Profiles that the API Consumer is eligible to use based on their agreements

    # Authorization and authentication

    The "Camara Security and Interoperability Profile" provides details of how an API consumer requests an access token. Please refer to Identity and Consent Management (https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/) for the released version of the profile.

    The specific authorization flows to be used will be agreed upon during the onboarding process, happening between the API consumer and the API provider, taking into account the declared purpose for accessing the API, whilst also being subject to the prevailing legal framework dictated by local legislation.

    In cases where personal data is processed by the API and users can exercise their rights through mechanisms such as opt-in and/or opt-out, the use of three-legged access tokens is mandatory. This ensures that the API remains in compliance with privacy regulations, upholding the principles of transparency and user-centric privacy-by-design.
