# DedicatedNetworks
Repository to describe, develop, document, and test the service APIs for DedicatedNetworks

## Scope

* Service APIs for DedicatedNetworks (see [APIBacklog.md](https://github.com/camaraproject/APIBacklog/blob/main/documentation/APIbacklog.md))
* The API provides the customer with the ability to:
  * request/modify/delete a (logical) dedicated network for API consumers. 
  * A dedicated network offers
    * specific connectivity performance (e.g. speed/ latency) 
    * during a specific time duration (e.g. one hour) and
    * at specific locations (e.g. the area of a festival)
  * A dedicated network may be ensured by an SLA.
  * API consumers are able to manage access to this dedicated network for specific devices.
* Describe, develop, document, and test the APIs
* Started: October 2024
